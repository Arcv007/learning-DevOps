# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing infrastructure using code instead of manual processes.

## Problems with Traditional Infrastructure
- Manual errors
- Slow provisioning
- Inconsistent environments

## Why Terraform?
- Supports multiple providers
- Uses a single workflow
- Manages state of infrastructure
